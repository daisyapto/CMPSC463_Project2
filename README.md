# CMPSC 463 (Design & Analysis of Algorithms) - Project 2

## Philadelphia Evaucation GPS
In this project, we developed an application that reads open source data on Philadelphia's streets and weather events. From this data, we can process the weather events
to allow users to find evacuation centers based on their location and their proximities to evacuation centers/shelters. We used graph data structures to develop algorithms
such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and K-nearest algorithm. From this, users will be able to input their location, and they will be provided with a visualization result
in a Folium map HTML file that provides them a highlighted map visualization of these algorithms run on the graph data from their source location.
